  {
    question: "How much does a custom website or web application cost?",
    answer: "Our web applications and business portals are quoted transparently based on project scope, starting at $1,200. Enterprise platforms and complex SaaS workflows receive bespoke milestone proposals."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does website development take?",
    answer: "A standard landing page or corporate profile website takes 7 to 14 business days. Complex e-commerce systems, database directories, or custom web portals average 3 to 6 weeks."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with international clients?",
    answer: "Yes, our primary focus is global. We support growing companies, startups, and enterprises in the US, the UK, the UAE, Australia, and worldwide through our remote engineering desk."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide SEO services?",
    answer: "Yes. Basic technical onsite SEO (correct title formats, descriptions, clean tag hierarchy, and structured JSON-LD schemas) is pre-configured on all our sites. We also offer dedicated global SEO campaigns and Map pack optimization."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide website maintenance?",
    answer: "Yes, we support our clients post-launch. We provide security configurations, hosting setups (Vercel/Netlify), backup schedules, content updates, and continuous speed tuning."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you redesign my existing website?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We migrate slow, legacy templates (like bloated WordPress builds) into high-performance, responsive Next.js storefronts or corporate profiles to increase page speed and capture conversions."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with startups?",
    answer: "Yes, startups are a core focus. We help early-stage ventures launch conversion-ready digital pages, configure lead capture fields, and connect trackers to validate their offerings."

    question: "Can you build e-commerce websites?",
    answer: "Yes. We build responsive e-commerce storefronts using Next.js. We integrate checkout funnels, secure payment links, catalog displays, and order management."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right custom website development company for my business?",
    answer: "When selecting a custom website development company, look for an agency that delivers custom, high-speed, and search-optimized Next.js/React solutions rather than rigid off-the-shelf templates. At Joy Digital, we act as your dedicated web engineering team, building bespoke web platforms engineered for sub-second speeds, mobile responsiveness, and enterprise Google search visibility."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I hire a bespoke web development team rather than using rigid templates?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between web design and web development?",
    answer: "Web design focuses on the visual layout, typography, UI/UX structure, and brand aesthetics. Web development involves writing clean, semantic code (Next.js, React) to turn designs into dynamic, fast-loading platforms."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the typical cost of custom web development?",
    answer: "The cost of bespoke web platforms ranges from $1,200 to $5,000+ for global B2B projects, depending on the complexity of the SaaS or headless e-commerce integration. We provide transparent milestone pricing with zero hidden fees."
  },
  {
    question: "Which languages and frameworks are best for modern web applications?",

  },
  {
    question: "How can businesses capture more global B2B leads?",
