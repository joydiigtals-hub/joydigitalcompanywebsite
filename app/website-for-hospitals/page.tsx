          <p>
            Patients seeking specialized treatments—whether cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, IVF, or cosmetic surgery—conduct meticulous research before choosing a hospital. International medical tourists look for doctor qualifications, treatment success rates, NABH/JCI accreditations, cost estimates, and visa assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, many hospital websites have confused navigation, slow mobile load speeds, buried doctor profiles, and lack direct medical opinion request forms or WhatsApp international patient desks.
