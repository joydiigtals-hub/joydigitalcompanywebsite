          <p>
            When potential customers need a local service near them, they open Google Maps or run search queries on their mobile phones. Google displays the top three maps profiles in the Local 3-Pack. If your profile is suspended, missing categories, or unoptimized, you are losing valuable phone leads and store visits to competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Joy Digital, our expert <strong>google business profile optimization</strong> service helps local companies claim, verify, and rank their profiles. We audit categories, resolve suspension issues, standardize addresses (NAP consistency), and link profiles to optimized local landing pages.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-primary-dark mt-8 mb-4">Why Google Maps Algorithms Value Profile Completeness</h3>
          <p>
            Google ranks map profiles based on relevance, distance, and prominence. We optimize relevance by adding accurate secondary categories, listing services with search terms, and writing detailed keyword descriptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also upload geotagged images, set up FAQ lists, and configure messaging shortcuts. To boost prominence, we launch customer review collection links, build high-authority local citations, and ensure details match across directories.
