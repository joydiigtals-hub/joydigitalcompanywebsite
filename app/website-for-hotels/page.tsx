          <p>
            International tourists and domestic leisure travelers actively search for direct hotel websites to find better room rates, exclusive package perks, early check-in options, and authentic photo galleries.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, most hotel websites suffer from slow room gallery rendering, broken reservation widgets, missing multi-currency prices, and complex checkout steps—forcing guests right back to OTA booking platforms.
