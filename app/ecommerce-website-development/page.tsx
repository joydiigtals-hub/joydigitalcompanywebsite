          <p>
            Standard e-commerce builders (like WooCommerce, Shopify, or Magento) can feel slow, bloated, and vulnerable to hacks. Every second of delay in loading products or rendering the checkout page directly reduces your conversion rates. To scale sales, you need a high-speed storefront built on modern headless technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Joy Digital, our specialized <strong>ecommerce website development</strong> uses **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. We separate the front-end display from the back-end database (headless architecture). This ensures your product pages load in under 1.2 seconds, even on slow mobile networks.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-primary-dark mt-8 mb-4">Optimized Checkout Funnels, Security, and Payment Gateway Setup</h3>
          <p>
            Over 70% of e-commerce carts are abandoned due to complicated checkouts or slow load times. We design checkout pages that make purchasing simple. We integrate domestic and international payment gateways, set up automated invoice emails, and construct product catalog feeds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because we build headless sites, there are no SQL databases directly connected to the front-end, making them secure against cyber threats. We also set up product structured data schemas (Product, Offer, and Reviews JSON-LD), helping your product listings rank in Google search.
          </p>
