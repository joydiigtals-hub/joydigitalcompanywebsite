            <p>
              If you are asking <strong>what is ai search optimization called</strong>, it is officially known in the digital marketing industry as Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) or Artificial Intelligence Optimization (AIO). The primary <strong>ai search optimization acronym</strong> is GEO. Some marketers also informally refer to this discipline as <strong>ai search optimization aso</strong> (AI Search Optimization / App Search Optimization) when engineering algorithmic search visibility for LLMs.

              Knowing how to <strong>optimize website for ai search</strong> requires moving beyond basic keyword density. <strong>AI search optimization</strong> focuses on establishing machine-readable entity relationships, publishing direct question-and-answer pairs, linking connected JSON-LD schemas, and boosting verifiable author E-E-A-T credentials.
