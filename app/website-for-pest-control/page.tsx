          <p>
            When homeowners or restaurant managers discover termites, bed bugs, cockroaches, or rodents, they act with extreme urgency. They search Google for immediate exterminators and choose the website that loads instantly, displays clear treatment packages, and offers 1-tap WhatsApp or phone contact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, many pest control websites suffer from slow mobile speeds, missing service area breakdowns, unorganized treatment packages, and lack of immediate emergency contact buttonsâ€”causing high-intent leads to bounce to competitors.
