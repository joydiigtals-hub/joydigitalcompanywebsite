            Industrial procurement officers, B2B sourcing managers, and engineering leads search the web with strict technical criteria—inspecting tolerance limits, material grades, machine tonnage, ISO accreditations, and production capacities before reaching out.

          <p>
            Unfortunately, most manufacturing websites look outdated, take over 5 seconds to load, hide machinery specs in clunky PDFs, and lack direct CAD file upload forms or instant WhatsApp inquiry options.
