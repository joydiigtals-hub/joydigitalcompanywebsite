          <p>
            Off-the-shelf software packages often fail to match your specific business operations, containing bloated features you do not need, or lacking critical database integrations. To streamline operations and scale efficiently, you need a custom web application built around your exact workflow rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Joy Digital, our specialized <strong>custom software development</strong> focuses on building secure database portals and SaaS applications. We design custom back-ends and connect them to fast React front-ends to ensure smooth performance across mobile and desktop devices.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-primary-dark mt-8 mb-4">API Configurations, CRM Integrations, and Process Automation</h3>
          <p>
            We help eliminate manual data entry by connecting your website to third-party tools (such as payment gates, invoicing, SMS notifications, and CRM systems). We build custom admin dashboards that let you check reports, manage user access, and coordinate customer requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our codebases are built using TypeScript and Node.js for scalability. We configure server setups, set up SSL security certificates, and run data validation checks to protect your database logs.
